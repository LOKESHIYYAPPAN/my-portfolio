    <p class="lead animate-slide-up">
        I’m a passionate full-stack developer focused on building real-world solutions through technology. My primary
        expertise lies in frontend development with Angular, where I’ve delivered robust, scalable, and responsive user
        interfaces.

        I also have hands-on project experience with React.js and enjoy exploring its ecosystem. On the backend, I work
        with Node.js and MongoDB to create efficient, RESTful APIs. I'm a strong advocate for clean code, continuous
        learning, and collaborative development.
